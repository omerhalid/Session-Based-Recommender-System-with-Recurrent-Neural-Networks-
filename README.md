# Session-Based-Recommender-System-with-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

In the dynamic world of online retail, personalized recommendations have become a not only an
added benefit for customers, but an expected part of the shopping experience. As an engineer fascinated by the intersection of data science, 
I undertook a project that allowed me to further explore this aspect of online retail. The goal of the project was to implement a session-based recommender system 
using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on a popular retail dataset - the RetailRocket.
